- The tools I’m using for project management is TODO’s in the code, placed at the top of one of the main files I’m always visiting. For version control, I’m using both Git command line and GitHub, these allow me to be versatile and update the game from any machine that I’ve cloned the game to. 

- To design my game, I’m using paper and drawing each sprite ahead of time, planning out what I want them to look like before making them in PICO-8.
    - I chose PICO-8 because of the simplicity, and also other people have recommended it to me, the language itself is quite similar to Python as well, so it made learning the language fast and really easy. 
    - There are no tools for documenting PICO-8’s specific version of Lua, so I will be doing it myself, unfortunately. For presenting my project, I’m using the bin export PICO-8 provides with the program in order to provide a game that you don’t have to download any other software in order to play. 


- For writing software, I’m using Visual Studio Code with the _pico8-ls_ extension to be able to read the code with colors more effectively. For testing software, since I can’t write unit tests, I have to rely on playing the game in order to test how the code is doing, and this can also rely on other people testing the code in order to let me know how it’s working, and what is broken/bugging out. 
    - The reason I chose Visual Studio Code is because the built-in code editor for PICO-8 is not that good, and it’s really restrictive on the width and height for the visible code you can se, also I just like coding in VS Code more, since it’s more popular in the industry.

- I’ve also used Youtube quite a bit in order to understand the Lua language better.
